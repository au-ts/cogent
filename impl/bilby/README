How to compile BilbyFs?

# Tested with linux-3.18.22. Similar versions should work.

Linux:

1 Download linux sources from <https://www.kernel.org/> and decompress it,
  then `cd` to the target folder

2 run `make menuconfig` and add MTD, UBI, etc as modules.

3 run `make prepare && make modules_prepare` in the linux sources directory

4 run `export KERNELDIR=path/of/linux/sources`

5 run `make` either in the c/ directory to build bilbyfs.ko,
  or in the cogent/ directory to build cgbilbyfs.ko.

Limitations:

- There is no mkfs for BilbyFs. When mounting BilbyFs for the first time, if
  the flash is empty, the in-kernel module (both C and Cogent versions) will
  automatically format the flash with BilbyFs format.
- The Cogent and C version of BilbyFs use a slightly different on-flash format.
  We cannot mount a file system formatted with C version with the Cogent version
  and vice versa.
- BilbyFs Cogent on-flash garbage collector is not implemented, so currently it
  does not recycle obsolete parts of the log.
- The Cogent code can sometimes run out of stack space, hence it's recommended
  to increase the kernel stack size to run Cogent BilbyFs.
