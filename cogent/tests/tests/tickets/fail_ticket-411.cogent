-- Fixed missing cases in a local routine of the Row module: it
-- inexplicably did not handle all cases for computing common fields for
-- complete rows. See the issue tracker (#411) on github for more
-- details.

foo : <A | B | C > -> ()

bar : () -> <A | B>

quux : () -> ()
quux x = foo (bar x)
