COGENT Installation
------------------

COGENT builds with the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)

Also tested with GHC-7.10.1, GHC-7.10.2 and GHC-7.10.3; GHC-7.8.3 has a chance to work.

1. Install GHC (version 7.8.4 for example)

  a) Download the right GHC distribution from https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_8_4
  b) Follow the instructions to install it (details omitted here)



2. Install cabal-install, and add '~/.cabal/bin' (or the directory in which cabal is installed) to your $PATH

  See https://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html for details
  
  NOTE 1): Please install cabal-install, not Cabal; be sure that you have a proper version of cabal-install which 
           is compatible with your ghc version;
       2): Old versions of cabal-install does not support sandbox. Please update to appropriate version (>= 1.18)
       3): If cabal-install is built against an older version of Cabal, you might get
             a warning when you build COGENT. To solve it, when you have cabal-install installed, build again against 
             a newer version of Cabal library.

  Install happy and alex, by
  $> cabal install happy alex

3. Install COGENT and its dependencies using a sandbox

* Automatic Installation
Simply run `./validate [-update-cabal -i]' under cogent folder and just wait with patience...... You're good to go!

NOTE: `-i' is highly recommanded if you are a human not a robot, because it will ask you when it tries to remove things.


* Manuel Installation

  $> cabal sandbox init
  $> cabal sandbox add-source ../isa-parser
  $> cabal install --only-dependencies
  $> cabal configure
  $> cabal build  # not `cabal install'

  NOTE 1): You might get an error about missing alex and/or happy. Just do `cabal install alex happy'.
             They will be installed to ~/.cabal/bin. Make sure this directory is in your $PATH.
       2): You might also get an error while install hcurses. You would need to install libncurses5-dev on
           debian/ubuntu (or equivalents on your platform).
       3): `cabal build' will build executable file in ./dist/build/cogent/ whereas `cabal install'
             will put the executable in the sandbox.
       4): You might get the error "ghc no longer supports single-file style package databases".
             This fixed it for me: remove your `dist' directory and run `ghc-pkg init dist'
       5): Due to some unknown GHC bug, linking might take extremely long. To solve it, you can either
           a) create a `cabal.config' file (if you don't have on) in your cogent folder, put the following 
              line into the file (without quotes): `executable-dynamic: True'
           b) add `--enable-executable-dynamic' flag to `cabal configure'. You may need `cabal clean' first. 

Command-line Options
--------------------

Run `cogent -?' to see the help message
`cogent --version' will print out the git revision in which you build your COGENT compiler.


Testing
-------

1. Run ‘./validate’ (with appropriate arguments) to test COGENT compiler. Test files are in ./tests

2. COGENT compiler also comes with a small unit-test module. To run that, do this:
  $> cabal configure --enable-tests
  $> cabal build
  $> cabal test

Note: You might run into this problem: "You need to re-run the 'configure' command".

Known Issues
----------

* In COGENT, type constructors (type names) and data constructors (tags) don't share
the same namespace. In C parser/AutoCorres, however, they share the same 
namespace. Which means, if in COGENT, a type and a tag have the same name, 
c-refinement proof will fail.

* If warnings are given by the typechecker, Isabelle embedding generation might
fail.

* Generating code with --ffncall-as-macro from non-ANF will cause problems. The
cause of the problem is our function calls are not truly function macros -- they
don't always obey macro's comma-parens separation rule.

* `''s (read: primes) in COGENT identifiers will cause problem: COGENT will turn `'' to
`_prime' in generated C code but not in theory files, whereas C parser/AutoCorres
doesn't do the same trick.

* Trailing `_'s (read: underscores) in COGENT identifiers are problematic as well.
They are not consisdered good names in Isabelle.

* Bool type is defined as u8 in generated C, with 1 being True and 0 False. This may
introduce inconsistency between COGENT semantics and C semantics. Extra care need be
taken when writing wrapper code.

* If a function signature is given in .cogent file, but the corresponding definition
is not given in .ac file, then COGENT compiler may not warn you.

* $exp antiquote is buggy. It seems to generate things as statements where expressions
are needed.

* Because Haskell is mostly non-strict, with some compiler command, it doesn't necessarily 
trigger compiler panic because the erroneous value is not (fully) evaluated.
Deepseq might be the cure. The difficulty is to define instances of NFData.

* $exp cannot call polymorphic functions, because the compiler has no way of knowing
what type instances are used by looking at the COGENT code. There is no easy cure. COGENT
compiler may need to *understand* the .ac files in order to check this. If poly-function
is called from .ac files, then it's very likely that the compiler will panic when
doing monomorphisation. The workaround is to define a wrapper function in a cogent program
which calls and instantiates the poly-function.
